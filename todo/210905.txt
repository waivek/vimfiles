twitter project idea - take a list of users, analyze all of their tweets, bucket in terms of frequency
                     - those who post >2 times in a day are probably noisy and not high-value, get 2 or 3 buckets and then generate views for these buckets
                     - you want to see all of jonathan blow’s tweets. it’s fine if you miss the random NFT artists 10th tweet in a day
youtube project idea - take a channel url. get all the videos. put it into the dlib factory view. add a date control that can be combined with a most-viewed control. 
                     - you want to see all the kanye west videos released this month, sorted by most-viewed to least viewed.
