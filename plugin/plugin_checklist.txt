1.    All registers, including @" and @', should be unchanged after the plugin has been called
2.    All marks, including '< and '>, should be unchanged after the plugin has been called
3.    If the plugin is in an 'ftplugin', mappings should be local [:h map-local]
4.    Preserve position of cursor (column AND row) and try to maintain this for undo

Visual Override Specific:
1. Is the command still repeatable if it was initially?
2. Is the cursor position the same as the pre-override behaviour?
